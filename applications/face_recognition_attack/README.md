# Face Recogniztion Attack

## white box attack
We chose a pre-trained FaceNet model that is a state-of-the-art and widely used face-recognition system as our white-box attacked model. We used gradient-based attacks methods and modify its loss function using FaceNet embedding distance.

FaceNet and its pre-trained model can be downloaded from `https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet`.
